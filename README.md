### For Graders:

Our final project is a web application that allows individuals in an apartment or house to share bills with one another in a sleek and easy to understand UI. 

### Our Web App, Bill Buddy, is hosted here. 

[Bill Buddy](https://jhchilds.w3.uvm.edu/final_proj/ "Login")

To make your grading easier you can navigate our site this way to view as much as our functionality as possible:

1. Navigate to [Bill Buddy](https://jhchilds.w3.uvm.edu/final_proj/ "Login")
2. Sign up for new account by clicking sign-up link.
3. Fill in details and click register button.

4.  (*Two Options*) **1)** Register with new address (this will give your user "admin" privelages, such as Adding and Deleting Bills) 
 **2)** Register with existing address. We have a sample group created with House Code 1. You will be able to see these bills as a "standard" user (can not add or delete bills). 


# Code
Our code will be submitted on Blackboard with links to this github repository as well as a link to the [Web App](https://jhchilds.w3.uvm.edu/final_proj/ "Login").

For security, we will not be submitting our database passwords. If you would like to connect to your own database, add your own passwords and usernames in lib/pass.php and lib/constants.php respectively using your given [UVM MySQL account](https://webdb.uvm.edu/account/ "WebDB UVM").

## Logical Flow of the System

1. User navigates to [Bill Buddy](https://jhchilds.w3.uvm.edu/final_proj/ "Login")

2. This is our sign-in page, as well as our index.
3. From here you can login, or register a new user. 
4. Either way, this will call upon the Auth class (**Auth.php**)
5. The Auth class defines the php session variable for all users, existing or newly created.
6. Auth.php also selects and inserts user information to our **MySQL** database.
7. After successful user authentication, all users are redirected to **dashboard.php**.
8. The Dashboard retrieves and prints all existing bills associated with the current user's address, specifically their addressId.
9. The **addressId** connects all users within the same group (apartment, house, unit etc...)
10. (Admin Only) From the dashboard, group admins can access **addBill.php** from the sidebar nav. 
11. **addBill.php** allows admins to create new bills for their group. 
12. These bills will be displayed on the dashboards of every user in the associated group reguardless of the status of the user.
